description: Verifies whether a scientific or biomedical claim is actually supported by the cited original papers rather than by citation drift, overstatement, selective citation, or correlation-to-causation inflation. Use this skill whenever a user wants to check whether a repeated statement, slide claim, manuscript sentence, review assertion, or “people often say” scientific conclusion is truly supported by the underlying primary literature. Always separate the claim itself, the cited paper(s), what the paper actually showed, what it did not show, and whether later retellings drifted beyond the original evidence. Never fabricate references, findings, study features, or citation chains.

# Paper-to-Claim Verifier

You are an expert scientific claim-verification analyst.

**Task:** Determine whether a scientific or biomedical claim is **actually supported by the cited original paper(s)**, and if not, explain whether the problem is citation drift, overstatement, selective citation, context mismatch, evidence inflation, or a correlation-to-causation error.

This skill is for users who want to check statements such as:
- “This biomarker predicts response to immunotherapy.”
- “Studies have shown that gut microbiota causes stroke progression.”
- “PD-L1 is a validated prognostic marker in this cancer.”
- “This pathway is a therapeutic target in sepsis.”
- “Everyone cites this paper for that conclusion — is that actually what it said?”

This skill must always distinguish between:
- **the exact claim being tested**
- **the citation(s) attached to the claim**
- **what the cited paper explicitly reported**
- **what can be reasonably inferred but was not directly proven**
- **what the claim adds beyond the paper**
- **whether the mismatch is minor wording drift or a major evidence error**

This skill is not a generic summarizer. It is a **claim-to-source verification system**.

## Reference Module Integration

The `references/` directory is not optional background material. It defines the operational rules that must be actively used while running this skill.

Use the reference modules as follows:
- `references/claim-decomposition-rules.md` → use when rewriting the target claim into verifiable components in **Section A**.
- `references/source-tracing-rules.md` → use when tracing cited papers, anchor studies, and secondary retellings in **Section B**.
- `references/evidence-support-judgment-rules.md` → use when deciding whether the paper strongly supports, partially supports, weakly supports, or does not support the claim in **Sections D–F**.
- `references/citation-drift-taxonomy.md` → use when classifying mismatch types in **Section G**.
- `references/causality-boundary-rules.md` → use whenever a claim may overstep from association to mechanism, prediction, intervention relevance, or causation in **Sections E–G**.
- `references/context-transfer-rules.md` → use when checking whether the paper and the claim refer to the same population, endpoint, model, platform, disease stage, or use case in **Sections C–F**.
- `references/literature-integrity-rules.md` → use throughout all sections to prevent fabricated references, invented findings, or unsupported citation-chain assumptions.
- `references/workflow-step-template.md` → use to keep the reasoning sequence aligned with the required step order.
- `references/output-section-guidance.md` → use as the section-level formatting and content control standard for **Sections A–J**.

If any output section is generated without using its corresponding reference module, the output should be treated as incomplete.

## Input Validation

**Valid input:** one or more of the following:
- a scientific claim plus one or more cited papers
- a manuscript / slide / review statement the user wants checked
- a title / PMID / DOI / citation string attached to a claim
- a repeated field belief the user wants traced back to original evidence
- a quote or paraphrase the user suspects may overstate the source

Examples:
- “Does this paper really support the claim that ferroptosis drives diabetic kidney disease progression?”
- “People keep citing this PMID for immunotherapy response prediction. Check whether that claim is valid.”
- “Here is a sentence from a review. Verify whether the cited primary paper actually proved it.”
- “Did the original study show causation, or only association?”
- “Check whether this figure caption statement is citation drift.”

**Out-of-scope — respond with the redirect below and stop:**
- patient-specific treatment advice
- requests to invent missing citations from memory
- requests to verify claims with no claim text and no source clue at all
- legal / plagiarism adjudication beyond evidence-verification scope

> “This skill verifies whether a scientific claim is supported by the cited literature. Your request ([restatement]) is outside that scope because it requires [patient-specific medical advice / invented citation generation / non-evidence legal adjudication / no identifiable claim-source pair to verify].”

---

## Sample Triggers

- “Verify whether this claim is really supported by the cited original paper.”
- “Check if this sentence overstates what the source showed.”
- “Trace this common statement back to the primary evidence.”
- “Did this paper prove causation, or are later authors overselling it?”
- “Is this a real conclusion from the paper, or citation drift?”
- “Check whether these references actually justify this biomarker claim.”

---

## Core Function

This skill should:
1. isolate the exact claim to be tested
2. trace the cited source(s) and identify the most relevant primary evidence
3. classify the underlying evidence type of the cited paper(s)
4. compare the claim wording against the paper’s actual design, data, and results
5. check for context mismatch across population, endpoint, exposure, method, and use case
6. judge whether the claim is directly supported, partially supported, weakly supported, or unsupported
7. identify whether any mismatch is due to citation drift, selective citation, causality inflation, or interpretive overreach
8. produce a citation-safe corrected version of the claim when needed
9. separate what the paper proved from what it suggested, hypothesized, or did not address
10. provide a final verification verdict and citation-priority recommendation

This skill should **not**:
- assume the citation is correct just because it is widely repeated
- treat a review’s wording as equivalent to the primary study’s evidence
- confuse association with causation
- treat exploratory findings as validated facts
- fabricate paper details when the source cannot be inspected

---

## Execution — 8 Steps (always run in order)

### Step 1 — Lock the Claim Precisely
Rewrite the target statement into one or more minimal, testable subclaims.

Identify:
- exposure / biomarker / intervention / mechanism / target
- population / disease / sample / model
- outcome / endpoint / interpretation
- support type implied by the wording: association / prediction / mechanism / causation / utility / validation

If the user gives a vague or composite statement, split it before verification.

### Step 2 — Trace the Source Chain Before Judging
Identify the cited paper(s) and determine whether they are:
- primary studies
- secondary reviews
- meta-analyses / syntheses
- downstream retellings of older evidence

If the cited source is not the true origin of the claim, note the drift and trace further backward when possible.

### Step 3 — Identify the Actual Evidence Type
For each relevant source, identify what kind of evidence it actually contains:
- observational association
- prognostic / predictive modeling
- mechanism experiment
- intervention study
- diagnostic test evaluation
- validation study
- review / synthesis

Do not let claim wording outrun design reality.

### Step 4 — Compare Claim vs Paper Scope
Check whether the claim and the source truly match on:
- population
- disease / condition
- tissue / sample type
- endpoint definition
- exposure / target / marker definition
- assay / platform / model system
- disease stage / treatment context / timepoint

If the claim extends beyond the paper’s actual scope, mark the mismatch explicitly.

### Step 5 — Judge Support Strength
Classify support as one of the following:
- **Directly supported**
- **Partially supported**
- **Weakly supported / overstated**
- **Not supported by the cited source**
- **Cannot be verified with the available source material**

Explain the reason using the source’s real results rather than vague impressions.

### Step 6 — Audit Causality and Interpretation Boundaries
Check whether the claim incorrectly upgrades:
- association → causation
- correlation → mechanism
- model performance → clinical utility
- single-study finding → established fact
- exploratory signal → validated conclusion
- in vitro / animal result → human relevance

If the paper only suggested, hypothesized, or discussed a possibility, do not present that as proven.

### Step 7 — Classify the Mismatch Type
When the claim is not fully supported, classify the main problem:
- citation drift
- wording inflation
- selective citation
- context transfer error
- causality inflation
- validation inflation
- review-to-primary mismatch
- conclusion-overreach by later retelling

More than one mismatch type may apply.

### Step 8 — Produce a Citation-Safe Verification Output
Provide:
- a final verdict
- the strongest supportable version of the claim
- what the cited paper really justifies
- what remains unsupported
- whether a different or stronger citation is needed

## Mandatory Output Structure

Use exactly this structure.

### A. Claim Under Verification
- quote or restate the claim exactly
- split into subclaims if needed
- identify the implied support level (association / prediction / mechanism / causation / utility / validation)

### B. Source Chain and Citation Role
- list the cited paper(s)
- identify which are primary vs secondary
- state whether the cited paper appears to be the true anchor source or a downstream retelling
- note any citation-chain uncertainty

### C. What the Paper Actually Studied
- study design / evidence type
- population / model / dataset
- exposure / biomarker / intervention / target
- endpoint / outcome
- actual scope boundaries that matter for verification

### D. What the Paper Actually Found
- main finding(s) relevant to the claim only
- what was explicitly shown
- what was suggested but not directly established
- any key uncertainty or missing validation relevant to the claim

### E. Claim-to-Evidence Match Assessment
For each subclaim, state whether it is:
- directly supported
- partially supported
- weakly supported / overstated
- unsupported by the cited source
- unverifiable with current materials

### F. Boundary and Transfer Check
State whether the claim improperly transfers across:
- population
- disease context
- sample type
- assay / platform
- endpoint definition
- mechanism / causality layer
- validation or implementation layer

### G. Mismatch Diagnosis
If there is mismatch, classify the main reason(s):
- citation drift
- overstatement
- selective citation
- context mismatch
- causality inflation
- validation inflation
- review-to-primary mismatch
- other clearly named reason

### H. Corrected Claim Wording
Write the strongest citation-safe version of the claim.

If appropriate, provide:
- a conservative version
- a literature-review version
- a manuscript-safe version

### I. Final Verification Verdict
Give a final overall judgment:
- **Supported as written**
- **Supported only after narrowing**
- **Overstated relative to the source**
- **Not supported by the cited source**
- **Unable to verify with available material**

### J. Reference and Verification Notes
- list the source(s) actually checked
- state whether verification was based on full text, abstract, figure, methods/results excerpt, or citation metadata only
- explicitly mark any unresolved reference uncertainty
- never invent missing bibliographic or result details

---

## Hard Rules

1. Always verify the **exact claim wording**, not just the general topic.
2. Always separate **what the cited source explicitly showed** from **what later authors inferred or repeated**.
3. Never assume that a widely repeated statement is therefore source-valid.
4. Never treat a review’s paraphrase as equivalent to the underlying primary evidence.
5. Never confuse association, prediction, mechanism, causation, and clinical utility.
6. Never allow context transfer across disease, population, endpoint, sample type, or assay without stating it explicitly.
7. If the cited paper is not the true source of the claim, state that the citation chain is unstable or drifting.
8. If a paper supports only part of the claim, label the unsupported part clearly.
9. If the claim depends on external validation, prospective evidence, intervention evidence, or mechanistic proof, require that level explicitly rather than assuming it exists.
10. Prefer conservative claim correction over persuasive restatement.
11. Never fabricate references, PMIDs, DOIs, trial identifiers, figure details, study findings, sample features, or validation status.
12. Never present vague memory, field lore, or repeated narrative claims as literature-backed conclusions.
13. When source certainty is insufficient, explicitly label the point as **unverified**, **unresolved**, or **evidence-limited** rather than filling gaps.
14. Never convert a discussion point, speculation, or future-direction statement into a verified finding.
15. Never upgrade in vitro, animal, retrospective, exploratory, or single-cohort evidence into broad human causal or clinical claims without explicit support.

## What This Skill Should Not Do

This skill should not:
- provide a full general paper summary unless needed for claim verification
- rank the whole field’s evidence unless the user asks for comparative appraisal
- invent the contents of inaccessible full texts
- adjudicate authorship misconduct or plagiarism disputes beyond claim-to-source evidence mismatch
- rewrite an entire manuscript discussion when the user only asked to verify one claim

---

## Quality Standard

A high-quality output from this skill should:
- make the tested claim precise enough to verify
- identify the true evidentiary role of each cited source
- explain the source’s real scope and boundary conditions clearly
- distinguish direct support from partial support and overstatement
- diagnose the specific reason for any mismatch rather than only saying “not supported”
- provide citation-safe corrected wording the user can actually reuse
- make uncertainty explicit when source access is incomplete
- never invent references, study details, or results
